I used the free Palmer Penguins data set in R to conduct analysis and create visualizations

## Reading tidyverse 

The following lines of code is reading in the tidyverse package so specific functions can be used to analyze the data.

```{r Loading Packages}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Loading in the palmer penguin data set

```{r Reading in Data}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguin_data <- penguins
```

## Gaining a general oversight of the data 

The **head()** and **tail()** functions give a general oversight of what the data is comprised of in terms of rows and columns.

```{r Overview of data}
head(penguin_data)
tail(penguin_data)
```

## Data tidying

The following lines of code are tidying the "penguin_data" data set. The code is removing any values in the data set that have an NA and creating a new data set called **"clean_penguin_data"**

```{r Data tidying}
clean_penguin_data <- penguin_data %>%
  drop_na()
```

## Data manipulation

The following lines of code are manipulation the "clean_penguin_data" data set. The code is converting millimeters to centimeters, and grams to milligrams. New columns will be created in the **clean_penguin_data**

```{r Data tidying}
clean_penguin_data <- clean_penguin_data %>%
  mutate(bill_length_cm = bill_length_mm/10,
         bill_depth_cm = bill_depth_mm/10,
         flipper_length_cm = flipper_length_mm/10,
         body_mass_mg = body_mass_g/1000)
```

## Data analysis of islands 

Below are lines of code that are summarizing the "clean_penguin_data" based on specific attributes. The following is grouping the data by *island*, and calculating the mean of bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. This data is added to a new data frame called **"island_penguin_summary"**.

```{r  Data Analysis by Island}
island_penguin_summary <- clean_penguin_data %>%
  group_by(island) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm),
            mean_bill_depth_mm = mean(bill_depth_mm),
            mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g))

```

## Data analysis of sex 

Below are lines of code that are summarizing the "clean_penguin_data" based on specific attributes. The following is grouping the data by *sex*, and calculating the mean of bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. This data is added to a new data frame called **"sex_penguin_summary"**.

```{r Data Analysis by Sex}
sex_penguin_summary <- clean_penguin_data %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm),
            mean_bill_depth_mm = mean(bill_depth_mm),
            mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g))
```

## Data analysis of species 

Below are lines of code that are summarizing the **"clean_penguin_data"** based on specific attributes. The following is grouping the data by *species*, and calculating the mean of bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. This data is added to a new data frame called **"species_penguin_summary"**.

```{r Data Analysis by Species}
species_penguin_summary <- clean_penguin_data %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(bill_length_mm = mean(bill_length_mm),
            mean_bill_depth_mm = mean(bill_depth_mm),
            mean_flipper_length_mm = mean(flipper_length_mm),
            mean_body_mass_g = mean(body_mass_g))
```

## Data visualization of body mass vs flipper length of penguins 

The code lines below are utilizing the **ggplot** package to visualize the "clean_penguin_data". This data is a scatter plot with *body mass* on the x-axis and *flipper length* on the y-axis, with the color of data points being differentiated by color. Additionally, the graph is facted by *species* of the penguins

```{r Visualization}
ggplot(data = clean_penguin_data,
       mapping = aes(x = body_mass_g, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm,
                     color = sex)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~species) +
  labs(x = "Body Mass of Penguins (g)",
       y = "Flipper Length of Penguins (mm)",
       title = "Body Mass (g) VS Flipper Length (mm) of Penguins") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
