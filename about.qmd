Hello, I'm Bailie! I am currently a senior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Science with an emphasis in Data Science. My overall mission is to tackle challenging real-world problems by harnessing the power of data. My main skills fall in the realm of data wrangling, manipulation, analysis, visualization, and management with the overall goal of driving decision-making.\
\
In addition to my academic and professional endeavors, I strive for diversity and inclusion in the tech community, with a particular interest in the queer tech community. I believe in the importance of fostering an inclusive environment where everyone's talents and perspectives are valued!
